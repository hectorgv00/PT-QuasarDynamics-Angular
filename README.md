## Usage üñêÔ∏è

The app is conected to https://reqres.in/ API, so both the both the login and register information must be as follows so it wotks:

    Login:
        {
        "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
        "password": "cityslicka"
        }

    Register:
        {
        "first_name": any,
        "last_name": any,
        "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
        "password": "pistol"
        }

If the user is not logged in, the users view and user detail view, will not be available, and will redirect to home automatically.

If done successfully, once registered or logged in, a Json Web Token will have been stored at the localstore, changing the header's view, as it will not show the login and register options, but the users option, and preventing the user to enter into the login/register route again.

Once logged in the user can access to the users view and user detail view.

In user detail, the delete button appears, and it calls to the API, but unfortunately, the API does not let its users be deleted, so the response has been hardcoded so it shows by console log that it has been deleted.
